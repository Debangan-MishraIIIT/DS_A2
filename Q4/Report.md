## Algorithm Overview
The BFT Generals Problem addresses achieving consensus in distributed systems with potential traitors. The solution requires:
1. Oral Messages: No cryptographic signatures; receivers must trust message content
2. T+1 Rounds: For `T` traitors, need `T+1` communication rounds
3. 3T+1 Nodes: Minimum `3T+1` generals to tolerate `T` traitors (BFT Resilience)

## Key Properties:
1. Safety: All loyal generals decide same action
2. Liveness: Eventually reach decision
3. Fault Tolerance: Works when `T < N/3`

## Implementation Details

1. Message Redundancy: `T+1` rounds ensure loyal generals receive original order through at least one honest path, multiple copies to identify inconsistencies
2. Traitor Detection: Honest nodes compare messages across rounds and identify conflicting orders from same sender. They use majority voting to filter outliers
3. Threshold Enforcement: With N â‰¥ 3T+1, honest majority (2T+1) can outvote traitors.
This prevents traitors from creating fake majority.
